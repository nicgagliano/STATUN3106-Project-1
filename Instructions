Project 1: Choose your own adventure
Here are a list of possible projects to try out:

Predicting churn in the NYC civil servants. Replacing people is costly and atypical departures could signal issues in management.
Using the payroll from different years, we can infer who has left the NYC payroll.
Does the budget help us predict this?
Does the census help us predict this?

Tariffs are coming. Predicting import/export alternatives for different products or different countries can be useful.
The monthly changes in import/exports can be found here

Housing prices is a major concern for young people.
Does the census contains information on spending on housing over the years
Social vulnerability talks about how different neighborhoods face different risk factors.

Data mining on menus. NY Public Library has a What’s on the menu? Project and its data, digitized versions of the menus, is posted here
Do we see the different cuisines/cultures from simply parsing menus?
Can we predict changes in menus?
Can we predict population changes from the menus? (This might require some old demographic data that’s beyond the American Community Survey)

Mining geospatial datasets listed here
E.g. predicting forest loss or its impact, e.g. CO2 maps from Planet Lab (application required!)

You can make this a trial run for your final project as well.
